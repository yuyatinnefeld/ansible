## About
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy.

## Benefit
- agentless (it uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure)
- crazy easy installation and initial setup
- it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) 
- OSS
- ansible is writted with python
